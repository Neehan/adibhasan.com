title: Welcome to my personal website

I am a Master's student at MIT LIDS advised by Prof. Munther Dahleh. My research is about using crop genetics and machine learning to engineer hybrid seeds with higher yields for African countries. 


Previously, I received my Bachelor's from MIT with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. After that, I worked as a quant developer in a startup for almost two years before coming back for my Masters. 


My interests include cooking, and dancing Bachata on the weekends. Here you can see some of the stuff I cooked in the past. 


I am an avid reader. I mostly read non-fiction: usually books on philosophy, history, economics, and social sciences.
